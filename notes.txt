What is Node.js?

    create app.js file

Running Project:
    node app.js
    http://localhost:3000/

Debug Packages:
    chalk - Adds color to logging
    debug - Only runs console logs when debug is set
        Run Command: 'DEBUG=* node app.js' (Run in BASH!)
    morgan - logs information about web traffic. Considered 'middleware' 

Tooling
    npm scripts in package.json
        To run debug script, run 'npm run debug'
    nodemon - Automatically restarts web server on code change
